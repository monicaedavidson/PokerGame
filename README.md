PokerGame
=========
This game was created with the tutorial from: http://www.informit.com/library/content.aspx?b=STY_JavaScript_24_hours&seqNum=227. The game is a basic version of Poker. HTML has been edited to include casino/poker chips and has been centered. 

The poker chips are from: ttp://assets.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/files/2012/10/PokerChips.jpeg

The function Deal, in JavaScript, was attempted to be edited to allow for a more precise "random." This didn't work out as planned.
