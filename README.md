PokerGame
=========
This game was created with the tutorial from: http://www.informit.com/library/content.aspx?b=STY_JavaScript_24_hours&seqNum=227. The game is a basic version of Poker. HTML has been edited to include casino/poker chips and has been centered. 

The poker chips are from: ttp://assets.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/files/2012/10/PokerChips.jpeg

The deal function was changed to a Fisher Yates shuffle function. Help with this was supplied from a wonderful lecture from Brook Riggio and also, http://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/.
